Hi thereðŸ‘‹. My name is Sheshank and I am currently studying Post Baccalaureate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Nipissing University.
I have a huge interest in Python, Data Science and Machine Learning.
During my undergrad, I made a project on Predicition of Pollution Level with an accuracy of 97%.
I look forward to create interesting and unique Machine Learning projects with all you folks.
Although, I am still in a bit of a learning curve, I am exploring every possiblity for making something unique which can practically help a lot of people out there.
